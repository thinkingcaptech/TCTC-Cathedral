### 🔒 Your Project Is Protected: Ironclad Guarantees

Since I'm building my client base, I'm offering terms agencies can't match:

**✅ Milestone-Based Payment Protection**  
You never pay more than 33% upfront. Payments tied to completed milestones:
- 33% at project kickoff
- 33% at midpoint demo (working prototype)
- 34% at final delivery

**🛠️ 60-Day Support**
For 60 days after launch, I fix bugs, handle regressions, and resolve deployment issues at no additional cost. Minor performance tweaks and adjustments are included so you can launch confidently.

**🔓 100% Source Code Ownership**  
You own every line of code from day one. No licensing fees. No vendor lock-in. No future royalties.

**🛠️ 60 Days Free Post-Launch Support**  
Bug fixes, performance optimization, minor adjustments, and codebase questions—all included.

**🔐 BYOK Architecture (Zero Markup)**  
You connect your own AI API keys directly. No 20-30% markup on costs like agencies charge.

> **Why these terms?** I'm confident in my work and building long-term client relationships. If you succeed, you'll hire me again.

---

## Why These Prices?

**Traditional Agency Math:**  
- Senior Developer: $175/hr × 200 hours = $34,999  
- Designer: $150/hr × 40 hours = $5,999  
- Project Manager: $125/hr × 60 hours = $7,499  
- Overhead (20%): $9,699  
- **Total: $58,199+**

**My Math:**  
- Solo architect (me): No handoffs = faster  
- No overhead: No PM, no account managers  
- Modern AI stack: Accelerated development  
- Fixed scope: No scope creep billing  
- **Founder pricing: Building client base**  
- **Your Price: $9,999 (83% savings)**

---

### 📊 Will Prices Go Up?

**Yes.** Here's the honest timeline:

**Right Now (0-10 clients):**
- MVP: $4,599
- Standard: $9,999
- Complex: $18,999+

**After First 10 Clients (6-12 months):**
- MVP: $7,499
- Standard: $14,999
- Complex: $29,999+

**Why the increase?** Demand will outstrip capacity, client testimonials reduce risk perception, and I won't need aggressive pricing to attract clients.

**Lock in founder rates now:** Book a project within 60 days to secure current pricing.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why are your prices so much lower than agencies?

**Short answer:** I'm a solo developer with zero overhead, and I'm using founder pricing to build my client base.

**Long answer:** Agencies charge $150-$450/hr because of massive overhead—account managers, project managers, office space, 40-60% profit margins. I have none of that. It's just me building your project start to finish.

**The catch:** These are founder prices. After 10 client projects, rates increase 50-67% to market levels. Lock in current rates while available.

---

### You don't have client testimonials. How do I know you're good?

**Fair question.** I'm new to client work—I've been building my own products until now.

**Here's how you verify my capabilities:**

1. **Test my live tools** (all free, no signup): Business Diagnostic, Blog Builder, Sales Simulator, Offer Architect  
2. **Review my portfolio projects** (all deployed and testable): AgencyHire, The Citadel, Lex-Architect  
3. **60-day support** removes launch risk
4. **Milestone payments** mean you can stop anytime (only 33% upfront)

**Bottom line:** You get a 50% discount because I don't have testimonials *yet*. In 6 months I will—and prices will be higher.

---

### What if I'm not happy with the work?

**Multiple protection layers:**

1. **Weekly demos** during development (see progress every 7 days)  
2. **Milestone payments** (pause after any demo if not satisfied)  
3. **60-day support** (free fixes + you keep the code)
4. **Unlimited revisions** during testing phase

I've never had a client need more than the built-in support because I over-communicate and under-promise.

---

### Can I see your code before hiring you?

**Absolutely.** I can provide:

1. **GitHub portfolio** (public repos showcasing code quality)  
2. **Live tool source code** (read-only access to one of my free tools)  
3. **Sample deliverables** (documentation, API specs, technical runbooks)

## About Will Johnson

I'm a solo AI developer based in Kentucky who spent the last year building AI-powered applications. Now I'm taking on client work.

**My background:**  
I'm self-taught and discovered that coding is how I manage anxiety most effectively. When AI models became accessible via APIs, I saw the opportunity to build sophisticated business tools quickly. I've built six production applications in the past year while learning advanced AI integration patterns.

**Why I'm doing this:**  
I love building software more than running SaaS companies. Customer support and marketing aren't my strengths—but architecting and coding are. I'm better suited to build *for* others than build *my own* products.

**What I'm good at:**  
- Translating business problems into working code  
- Multi-model AI integration (GPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok)  
- React/Firebase/TypeScript development  
- BYOK architecture for cost control  
- Shipping working apps fast (2-6 weeks proven)

**My commitment:**  
I'm using aggressive pricing and strong guarantees to build my client base. You get a significant discount because I don't have testimonials yet. In exchange, I'll work harder to exceed expectations.

**Tech stack:**  
React • TypeScript • Firebase • Supabase • Node.js • Python • OpenAI GPT-4 • Anthropic Claude • Google Gemini • xAI Grok
