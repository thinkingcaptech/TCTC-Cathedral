    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>Thinking Cap Trinity Consulting (TCTC) is a boutique Builder-Consultant practice focused on applied AI architecture.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Contact details you submit (name, email, phone).</li>
      <li>Project context you share (requirements, goals, constraints).</li>
      <li>Basic site analytics (cookies for usage only).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To respond to your inquiries and deliver consulting/engineering services.</li>
      <li>To improve site experience and performance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>AI Disclaimer Clause</h2>
    <p>TCTC is not liable for inaccuracies or “hallucinations” generated by third-party AI models. You must review and validate any AI-generated output before relying on it in production.</p>

    <h2>BYOK Data Sovereignty Clause</h2>
    <p>Clients retain full ownership of their API keys and data. TCTC acts as an architecture provider, not a data processor, for AI interactions. BYOK means you connect directly to AI providers; we do not store, resell, or route your keys or payloads through TCTC-owned services unless explicitly agreed in writing.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your data. We only share data with vendors required to deliver services you request (e.g., hosting, analytics).</p>

    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>We use cookies for basic analytics. You can accept or decline via the on-site cookie banner.</p>
