The AI Sales Simulator is your pressure-free reps practice room. Build custom buyer personas, define likely objections, and run realistic call flows without burning real prospects.

### What you can do

- **Persona lab** – craft ideal buyers with industry, role, pain points, budgets, and tones.
- **Live objection playground** – queue the objections you want to master and let the AI deploy them intelligently.
- **Conversation analytics** – real-time transcripts, talk-to-listen ratios, objection outcomes, and coaching prompts.
- **Session exports** – download transcripts, feedback summaries, and action plans for future reviews.

### How it works

1. Enter the scenario: persona, product pitch, pricing, competitive edges.
2. Choose your model (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, or Grok 2) and difficulty level.
3. Run the call in-browser with audio or text, pausing or restarting whenever you want.
4. Review the transcript, spotting dropped objections and suggested follow-ups.

Hook the Firebase-backed simulator you already built into `/js/tools/sales-simulator.js` and reuse the BYOK panel to keep user keys safe. This page will host the polished UI while future enhancements (multi-agent buyers, CRM push) stay consistent with the TCTC visual language.
