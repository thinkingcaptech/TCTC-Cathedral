Aether is the campaign operating system for operators who want AI to orchestrate launches, nurture tracks, and offer rollouts without duct-taped spreadsheets.

### Capabilities

- **Offer design canvas** – define promise, proof, positioning, and bonuses in one structured brief.
- **Channel generator** – output synced email sequences, ads, landing copy, and social snippets with shared messaging pillars.
- **Automation-ready exports** – ship JSON packages to Zapier, Make, or your internal workflow builder with a single click.
- **Persona + voice memory** – store tone profiles, customer research, and compliance notes for future campaigns.

### Getting value

1. Fill out the offer + audience brief (use saved presets for future launches).
2. Choose the AI stack (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Gemini 1.5) and attach any reference docs.
3. Generate campaign assets per channel, editing inline with the structured editor.
4. Export campaign kits and deploy them to your automation tools or internal teams.

Wire your existing prototype into `/js/tools/aether-engine.js` when it’s ready—the placeholder below is prepped for the full interface, BYOK controls, and analytics tracking so this page can become the flagship landing page for the engine.
