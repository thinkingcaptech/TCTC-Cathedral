## Placeholder Files

Until you add the actual files, the site will function but audio players won't load and images won't display. This is normal during development.

## Adding Your Files

1. Place `logo.svg` in: `src/assets/`
2. Place `profile.jpg` in: `src/assets/`
3. Place all MP3 files in: `src/assets/music/`

The site will automatically detect and use them once placed in the correct locations.
