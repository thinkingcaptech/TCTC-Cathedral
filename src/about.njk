      <h2 class="mb-3">I Build Tools I Actually Use</h2>
      
      <p>
        I'm not a theorist. I'm not an academic. I don't write about business from the sidelines.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I run businesses. I solve real problems. And when I can't find a tool that works the way I need it to, 
        I build it myself.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Every software tool in the Modern AiChemy catalog started as a solution to my own friction. 
        The Local SEO Builder? I needed to generate content fast for a client with 10 locations. 
        The Sprint Dashboard? I was drowning in quarterly goals with no visual way to track progress.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I don't build tools for the sake of building tools. I build them because I need them. 
        And if I need them, chances are you do too.

      <h2>The Mission That Fuels Everything</h2>
      
      <p>
        I'm a single father in the middle of a custody battle. My children are everything to me.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        On January 1st, 2025, I have a court date that will determine whether I can stay in my kids' lives 
        the way I want to. Legal representation isn't cheap — I need $3,000 to afford the help I need.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        But I refuse to beg. I refuse to ask for charity. Instead, I'm offering value.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Every tool I sell helps a business grow. Every song I create gives a brand its voice. 
        Every bundle transforms someone's trajectory. This isn't extraction — it's exchange.

{# The Philosophy - Why AI + Human #}

    <div style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
      
      <h2 class="mb-3">AI Amplifies, It Doesn't Replace</h2>
      
      <p>
        There's a narrative out there that AI is coming to take jobs, replace creativity, and make humans obsolete.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        That's not how I see it.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        AI is a lever. It's an amplifier. It takes what you already know and makes it faster, sharper, more scalable. 
        But without human judgment, human creativity, and human empathy, AI is just noise.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I use AI to generate drafts, not finished products. To suggest ideas, not dictate them. 
        To speed up the boring parts so I can focus on the parts that matter — the strategy, the story, the soul.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        That's the philosophy behind Modern AiChemy: <strong>AI amplifies human creativity, it doesn't replace it.</strong>

{# The Principles - How I Work #}
<section class="section section-primary">
  <div class="container">
    
    <div style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
      
      <h2 class="mb-3">How I Work</h2>
      
      <h3>Transparency Over Hype</h3>
      <p>
        I don't make promises I can't keep. I don't claim to be the best, the biggest, or the most anything. 
        I just build good tools and tell the truth.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Service Over Extraction</h3>
      <p>
        I'm not here to squeeze every dollar out of you. I'm here to deliver value. 
        If a tool doesn't work for you, get a refund. If a song isn't right, I'll revise it until it is.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Signal Over Noise</h3>
      <p>
        Every business decision passes through one filter: Does this increase signal or increase noise? 
        If it's noise, it doesn't happen.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Long-Term Over Short-Term</h3>
      <p>
        I'm not running a flash-in-the-pan hustle. I'm building systems that last. 
        Tools that endure. Relationships that matter.
